Images, generated with [Context Free](https://www.contextfreeart.org/index.html). The description of an image is in the form of a **context free** grammar and is called a `cfdg` file (context free design grammar). Some of the files were initially written in **Context Free Version 2** (many years ago) and [automatically translated to Version 3](https://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/translate.php).
